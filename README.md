# BigDataAnalytics - Privacy-Preserving Query Mechanisms for Spatiotemporal Data
Project Overview
This project investigates and compares multiple privacy-preserving query mechanisms for spatiotemporal data. We analyze the effectiveness, efficiency, and trade-offs between utility and privacy for various techniques including K-anonymity, Laplace noise, temporal cloaking, and a novel combined approach using both Laplace noise and K-anonymity.
Motivation
As location-based services become increasingly prevalent, the need to protect user privacy while maintaining data utility has become critical. Spatiotemporal data is particularly sensitive as it can reveal personal information, habits, and behaviors when analyzed over time.
Privacy Mechanisms Investigated
K-anonymity
Ensures that for any query result, the data of at least K different individuals are indistinguishable from each other, preventing the identification of specific individuals within the dataset.
Laplace Noise
Implements differential privacy by adding calibrated Laplace-distributed noise to query results, providing mathematical privacy guarantees while maintaining statistical accuracy.
Temporal Cloaking
Delays or aggregates data over time periods to obscure exact temporal information, reducing the precision of time-based inferences.
Combined Approach (Laplace Noise + K-anonymity)
A novel hybrid solution that leverages the strengths of both K-anonymity and Laplace noise to provide strong privacy guarantees while minimizing utility loss.
Dataset
Our experiments use [DATASET NAME] containing [brief description of data characteristics]. The dataset includes [number] records with spatiotemporal attributes collected over [time period].
